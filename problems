Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: 
Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`hyper-cinema`.`#sql-4f4_1bc`, 
CONSTRAINT `FK9s3xebn2koesgo2oeabs9djvf` FOREIGN KEY (`id`) REFERENCES `schedule` (`id`))

    Background
    I found out the answer to my own question. It was never a problem with any of the actual database handling. 
    It turns out, when I was passing the id to be used as the foreign id in hashtags and references, 
    I was getting my id from a counter in the main class; where every new tweet had a number that went with each 
    hashtag and reference for that tweet that would later be used as a foreign key. 		
    That foreign key would reference the primary key in the tweets table, which auto increments.
    
    Here was the problem:
    It turns out that MySQL is NOT zero-indexed when you auto-increment; 
    where the first value is zero, then one, then two, etc. Instead, it starts at one. 
    So when I tried to reference the primary key with the foreign key, 
    the counter that started at zero for every tweet that I assigned (the foreign key) 
    was being incorrectly matched to the auto incrementing tweet id in the tweets table (primary key).
    
    Therefore, I was always off by one.

 - Do we need getAllHalls() method?
